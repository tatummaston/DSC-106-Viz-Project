                <h2>The pandemic has provided us with a unique natural experiment:</h2>
                <h2>If you cease normal human activity, how much cleaner would the air be?</h2>

            <h3>The answer: Much clearer.</h3>

                <h2>As seen here, transportation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions</h2>
                <h2>from the United States as a whole.</h2>

                <h3>This can be due to its large city area, as seen in the graph. Because LA is so spread</h3>

                <h3>we can only hope that the post-pandemic world will create an opportunity for the air to recover from human activity,</h3>
                <h3>as the amount of remote workers has skyrocketed.</h3>
